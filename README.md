# Inquiry: Futures

Inquiry is an expressive API that allows one ask multiple questions about a subject value, and observe all results. This process returns a collection of all passes, fails, and the original subject value.

## Documentation

Please see [`inquiry-monad`](https://github.com/rgeraldporter/inquiry-monad) for the main documentation. This module just adds the ability to use `InquiryF`, and contains no special APIs. It is equivalent to the API of `InquiryP`.
